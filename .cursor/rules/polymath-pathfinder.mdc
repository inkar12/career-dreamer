# Polymath User Approach for Pathfinder

## Core Principle

Polymaths are optimized for "wicked" environments where rules change. Treat curiosity as an asset, not noise. Never punish exploration; redirect it.

## Career Output Rules

- **Output intersection roles** (pillar + spark), not generic jobs
- Each career option must include: why fit, proof task (1–2h), 2-week experiment
- Use `polymathMeta` on CareerNode for intersection careers
- Match keywords across multiple domains (e.g. "art + science" → Science Communicator)

## Anti-Failure Rules

- Never let users run 3 pillars concurrently; enforce serial mastery (one at a time)
- Always output next action as a small proof task, not vague "explore more"
- Reframe "too many interests" as M-shape, not confusion

## Output Templates

**Intersection Career Option:** Title, Intersection (Pillar + Spark), Why it fits (2 bullets), Proof task (1–2h), 2-week experiment

**M-Shape Card:** Stability Pillar, Growth Pillar, Curiosity Playground, Current Active Pillar, Next 4-week milestone

**Idea Trap Note:** Title, What I learned (5 bullets), Tags, Possible future connections

## Matching Logic

- Detect polymath signals: "many interests", "intersection", "cross-domain", "innovation", "futures"
- Prioritize careers with polymathMeta when user expresses polymath pattern
- Require 2+ domain match for cross-path results; single-domain = too narrow
