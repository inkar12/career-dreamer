# Polymath User Approach for Pathfinder

> Product/UX + logic spec for "how to approach polymath people"

## 0. Core Principle

Polymaths are not "confused specialists." They are optimized for "wicked" environments where rules change and cross-domain pattern recognition wins. Treat curiosity as an asset, not noise.

## 1. Onboarding Goal

Turn "too many interests" into a structured map that creates immediate clarity and momentum.

**Avoid:** "Pick one passion" framing, forcing one career label too early, generic advice  
**Use:** asset mapping, synthesis at intersections, one-pillar-at-a-time strategy

## 2. Step-by-Step Flow

### Step 1: Asset Map

- **Pillars of Depth:** "List 2–3 areas where you already have real skill or deep knowledge"
- **Sparks of Curiosity:** "List 3–5 things you're currently fascinated by"
- **Synthesis Check:** "Find one unexpected connection between a pillar and a spark"

### Step 2: M-Shape Blueprint

- **Stability Pillar:** good enough job that preserves energy
- **Growth Pillar:** next deep dive skill/career option
- **Curiosity Playground:** no-commitment zone for dabbling

### Step 3: Build Strategy (prevent Dash-Shape)

- One pillar at a time
- Commit for a season (e.g. 18 months)
- "15% push" through plateaus
- "Graduate," don't "quit"

### Step 4: Idea Trap

- **Capture:** time-boxed curiosity (30 min, 2 hours, 1 evening)
- **Store:** tag with #domain
- **Connect:** resurface when relevant to current pillar

## 3. Output Templates

## 4. Anti-Failure Rules

- Never punish exploration; redirect it into the Trap
- Never let them run 3 pillars concurrently; enforce serial mastery
- Always output next action as a small proof task, not vague "explore more"
