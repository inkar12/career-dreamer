# Kindscale AI

A standalone app to store thoughts for AI-assisted critical thinking development.

## Run

```bash
cd kindscale-ai
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## How it works

1. **Add thoughts** — Capture ideas, beliefs, or arguments you want to develop
2. **Choose a prompt** — Pick how AI should engage:
   - **Challenge** — Surface blind spots and counterarguments
   - **Deepen** — Go deeper into the line of thought
   - **Question** — Probing questions to sharpen the idea
   - **Reflect** — Mirror back and expose assumptions
3. **Copy for AI** — Paste into Cursor or any AI chat; the app formats your thought with the right prompt

All data is stored locally in your browser (localStorage).
